# üçè Isaac ROS Template

**REPOSITORY UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Do you want to build your own NVIDIA Isaac ROS docker for your robot? this template fit for you!

**You only need to fork this repository!**

Menu:
 * [What do you need?](#what-do-you-need)
 * [Where to edit?](#where-to-edit)
 * [Build Isaac ROS Docker image](#build-isaac-ros-docker-image)
 * [Run You Isaac ROS docker container](#run-you-isaac-ros-docker-container)
 * [Debug your container](#debug-your-container)

# What do you need?

You need:
 * [NVIDIA Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/buy-jetson)
   *  NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier
   *  NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX
   *  NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4Gb or 2Gb)
 * [NVIDIA Jetpack 4.6.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/jetpack-sdk-461)

If you are looking to build a docker container for **x86 machines**, please look the [NVIDIA Isaac common](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS/isaac_ros_common) repository 

# Where to edit?

There are three parts on this template to edit:
1. [Dockerfile](#dockerfile)
2. [01_isaac_ros.rosinstall](#01_isaac_rosrosinstall)
3. [02_your_ros2_pkgs.rosinstall](#02_your_ros2_pkgsrosinstall)

Let's move step by step and learn where you need to change

## [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile)

There are mainly 3 stage where you can work:
 * [**Stage 2**](#stage-2-install-dedicate-packages-for-isaac-ros) _(around line 128)_: "Install dedicate packages for Isaac ROS"
 * [**Stage 4**](#stage-4-install-your-ros2-dependecies) _(around line 161)_: "Install your ROS2 dependecies"
 * [**Stage 7**](#stage-7-write-your-runtime-command-at-startup) _(around line 206)_: "Write your runtime command at startup"

### (Stage 2) Install dedicate packages for Isaac ROS

If you are working with a specific Isaac ROS package, maybe you need to add specific dependecies.

Below an example of dependecies you need to install for certain packages:

```Dockerfile
RUN aaa
```

**Remember to follow the [Docker writlines](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/) guidelines to install al you need.**

### (Stage 4) Install your ROS2 dependecies

Like the [stage 2](#stage-2-install-dedicate-packages-for-isaac-ros) write in this stage all dependecies you need to be able to build your ROS2 packages.

**Remember to follow the [Docker writlines](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/) guidelines to install al you need.**

### (Stage 7) Write your runtime command at startup

In this stage you need to uncomment the last line and write your specific launcher you want to run.

```Dockerfile
# CMD ["ros2", "launch", "your_pkg", "your_launcher.launch.py"]
```

## [01_isaac_ros.rosinstall](/01_isaac_ros.rosinstall)

This *rosinstall* file collect all Isaac ROS repository you need to use for your robot.

Do you know how to make a rosinstall file? The full rosinstall documentation is available [here!](https://docs.ros.org/en/independent/api/rosinstall/html/rosinstall_file_format.html)

Briefly you need only to add after Isaac ROS common, 3 lines for each repository like below:

```yml
- git:
    local-name: <REPOSITORY NAME>
    uri: <REPOSITORY URL>
```

## [02_your_ros2_pkgs.rosinstall](/02_your_ros2_pkgs.rosinstall)

Like [above](#01isaacrosrosinstall) you can add here all your workspaces you want to add in your Dockerfile

# Build Isaac ROS Docker image

```
bash build_image.bash [PROJECT_NAME]
```

**PROJECT_NAME** = Name project build

**Options:**
 * **-v** - Verbose
 * **-ci** - Build docker without cache
 * **--push** - Push docker image. Before to push, you need to be logged in
 * **--tag [TAG_NAME]** - Tag release (Default tag: *latest*)
 * **--pull-base-image** - Force to re-pull the base image

This script also *check* in the beginning if:
 1. You are running on ARM64 architecture
 2. Your NVIDIA Jetson have the [right requirements](#what-do-you-need)
 3. Your NVIDIA Jetson use the right NVIDIA runtime container and is able to build a certain of Isaac ROS packages

## Example output

Such as example if you want to build an image `isaac_ros_template` you will need to write:

`bash build_image.bash isaac_ros_template` where the docker image will be: `isaac_ros_template:latest`

# Run You Isaac ROS docker container

If you are reading this chapter, you are in the end of the process and you want to try Isaac ROS.

```
docker run --rm --network host [PROJECT_NAME]:latest
```

What are means the options above:
 * **--rm** - When you switch off the container will be also deleted
 * **--network host** - This container will share the network with the host. This option is helpful to read all topics from your host or from your laptop.

**Hint:** there are devices that need to be conneted with your container. You can also add the option **--device** or **--privileged**.

## Docker Compose

Another way to use your docker image, is make a docker compose file, if you never hear that, watch the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

```yml
version: "3.9"
services:
  isaac_ros_service: 
    image: [PROJECT_NAME]:latest
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      # If you are working with a MIPI camera
      # you need to uncomment the line below
      # - "/tmp/argus_socket:/tmp/argus_socket" 
```

## Example output

If you have build your image with `isaac_ros_template` the command will be like:

`docker run --rm --network host isaac_ros_template:latest`

# Debug your container

A good way to work with your docker image and check works well or is well built, you can use the command below

```
docker run --rm --network host -it [PROJECT_NAME]:latest bash
```

or if you want to test meanwhile the docker is running you can use:

```
docker exec -it <DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME> bash
```

In this case, your terminal will be attached to the your docker Isaac ROS container.
